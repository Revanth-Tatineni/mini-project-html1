    <h2>Project: Encryption Algorithm Prediction Using Machine Learning & Deep Learning Models</h2>
    <p>This project involves designing a machine learning system to classify encryption algorithms based on ciphertext 
characteristics. The system uses features like key length, block size, and ciphertext length, processed with TF-IDF and feature 
scaling. Multiple models were trained, with Random Forest achieving the highest accuracy of 88.88%. It aims to support 
cybersecurity by enabling real-time encryption detection and future integration of advanced features like entropy analysis. system 
uses a motor driver to control the wheels based on the received commands.</p>
